## a public repository

I generally can't decide, when I create repository, whether I want its contents to be public or private.  In fact, I tend to to change my mind about that all the time.  I have definite internal conflicts.

| Reasons make a repository public                    | Reasons to keep a repository private                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| so the world can see how brilliant I am             | so the world can't see all my stupid mistakes       |
| because this code is small or simple                | because this code took a lot of work to create      |
| because this code is nothing special                | because this code is *mine*; go write your own code |
| because I just want to share some useful techniques | because I want to sell this and make some money     |

This time, I'm creating a repository with no specific purpose in mind, other than to have a public repository.  I don't know what I'm going to put it in yet.  I'm not even giving it a descriptive name yet; it's just "public".  I might never use it, but if I do, I don't want to second-guess myself later and waste any time deciding if I want it to be public or private.  If I put it in here, it's going to be public.  The repository name is "public", and the only content is has so far is a couple of README files and a public license (the GNU GPL).  So -- note to my future self -- don't bother putting something here unless I'm sure I want it to be public.
