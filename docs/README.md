## a public repository

I generally can't decide, when I create repository, whether I want its contents to be public or private.
In fact, I tend to to change my mind about that all the time.  I have definite internal conflicts.

| Reasons make a repository public                    | Reasons to keep a repository private                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| so the world can see how brilliant I am             | so the world can't see all my stupid mistakes       |
| because this code is small or simple                | because this code took a lot of work to create      |
| because this code is nothing special                | because this code is *mine*; go write your own code |
| because I just want to share some useful techniques | because I want to sell this and make some money     |
