# public
a public repository

I generally can't decide, when I create repository, whether I want its contents to be public or private.
In fact, I tend to to change my mind about that all the time.  I have definite internal conflicts.

| because this code is small, simple, or otherwise nothing special | because this code took a lot of work to create, and it's *mine*; go write your own |
| because I just want to share some useful techniques              | because I want to sell this and make some money                                    |
